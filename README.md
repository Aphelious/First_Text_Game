## First_Text_Game

Concept

This is my first D&D-style text adventure game. The idea is that you head into a dungeon and encounter creatures that you will either have to fight or flee from. The center of the dungeon is a 'treasure room' where you obtain a randomly-generated special item that you can then hold on to for future excursions into the dungeon. The player then must make it back out of the dungeon alive if they want to keep the booty. Since the idea of the game is that entering the dungeon is a risk/reward tradeoff, the further you get into the dungeon the more powerful the monsters will be. Ideally a player will just make it out with a few health points left. The exciting part is to see if one can fight and flee at the right times, of course with a heavy dose of randomness thrown in. At some point it might make sense to retreat from the dungeon and try again, then of course getting out with your life will be the tricky part. Getting pushed back a step is the is designed to be a constant obstacle, in addition to the damage taken during battle. 

In the future I'd also like to incorporate puzzles to act as 'booby traps' but I haven't figured that out yet. 

Gameplay

The battle system incorporates some randomness in the form of an evade metric that allows both players and creatures to sometimes evade attacks. The same evade 
metric is used when a player attempts to flee a creature.
