# First_Text_Game

# This is my first D&D-style text adventure game. The idea is that you head into a dungeon and encounter creatures that you will either have to 
# fight or flee from. The center of the dungeon is a 'treasure room' where you obtain a randomly-generated special item that you can then hold on to for 
# future excursions into the dungeon. The player then must make it back out of the dungeon

# The battle system incorporates some randomness in the form of an evade metric that allows both players and creatures to sometimes evade attacks. The same evade 
# metric is used when a player attempts to flee a creature. 

# In the future I'd also like to incorporate puzzles to act as 'booby traps' but I haven't figured that out yet.
